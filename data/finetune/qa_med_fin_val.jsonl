{"domain": "medical", "input": "A patient is worried about starting a statin for high cholesterol because they heard it can cause muscle pain.", "output": "Explain that statins lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes for people at higher cardiovascular risk, but some people do experience muscle aches or weakness. Clarify that serious muscle or liver problems are rare. Encourage the patient to report new muscle pain, dark urine, or unusual tiredness to their own doctor promptly, and not to stop the medicine without discussing alternatives or dose adjustments."}
{"domain": "medical", "input": "My fasting blood glucose came back at 110 mg/dL. What does this mean?", "output": "A fasting blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL falls into the 'prediabetes' range (usually defined as 100–125 mg/dL). This does not mean you have type 2 diabetes yet, but it indicates insulin resistance. Lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, can often reverse this number. You should schedule a follow-up with your primary care provider to discuss an HbA1c test for a more comprehensive view."}
{"domain": "medical", "input": "Someone with asthma wants to know the difference between a rescue inhaler and a daily controller inhaler.", "output": "Explain that a rescue inhaler works quickly to relieve sudden symptoms like wheezing or shortness of breath, while a controller inhaler is used every day to reduce inflammation and prevent attacks. Emphasize that they should follow their own asthma action plan from their clinician, and not change doses without medical advice. Encourage them to ask their doctor how to use each inhaler correctly and when to seek urgent care."}
{"domain": "medical_finance", "input": "I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that might reduce my ability to work in 5 years. How should I prepare financially?", "output": "1. Disability Insurance: Prioritize getting long-term disability insurance now while you are still working; check if your employer offers a portable policy. 2. Aggressive Debt Paydown: Eliminate monthly obligations (car payments, credit cards) to lower your future 'baseline' cost of living. 3. Skill Pivot: Consider retraining for remote or less physically demanding roles that align with your potential limitations."}
{"domain": "medical", "input": "A person with high blood pressure is checking readings at home and sometimes sees 150/95. They ask if they should go to the emergency room immediately.", "output": "Clarify that a single elevated blood pressure reading without severe symptoms (such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, confusion, or weakness on one side) usually does not require an emergency room visit. Explain that they should sit quietly, re-check after several minutes, record their readings, and contact their own doctor for advice. Stress that if they develop warning symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or neurological changes, they should seek emergency care."}
{"domain": "medical_finance", "input": "I have $3,000 in my HSA. Can I use it to pay for my wife's dental surgery even if she isn't on my insurance plan?", "output": "Yes. IRS rules allow you to use your HSA funds for 'qualified medical expenses' for yourself, your spouse, and your tax dependents, even if they are covered by a completely different insurance policy (or no insurance at all). Keep the receipt for the dental surgery in case of an audit."}
{"domain": "medical", "input": "Patient with type 2 diabetes on metformin asks: 'Is it safe to keep taking this with mildly reduced kidney function?'", "output": "Explain that metformin is usually avoided if kidney function (eGFR) is severely reduced because of lactic acidosis risk. Mention typical eGFR cutoffs, advise checking latest labs, and clearly state that final decisions must be made with the patient’s own doctor. Avoid giving an exact dose change."}
