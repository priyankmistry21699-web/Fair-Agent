{"domain": "finance", "input": "Explain insomnia in relation to sleep hygiene and insomnia management.", "output": "Adults need 7-9 hours sleep nightly for optimal health. Poor sleep linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular \ndisease, depression, and impaired cognitive function. Sleep hygiene practices: maintain consistent sleep schedule \n(same bedtime/wake time daily including weekends); create dark, quiet, cool bedroom environment (60-67°F optimal); \navoid screens 1-2 hours before bed (blue light disrupts circadian rhythm); limit caffeine after 2pm and alcohol \nbefore bed; exercise regularly but not close to bedtime; avoid large meals late in evening; reserve bedroom for \nsleep and intimacy only. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first-line treatment for chronic \ninsomnia. Sleep aids should be used sparingly and under medical supervision due to side effects and dependence risk. For specific questions about insomnia, consult a financial professional."}
{"domain": "finance", "input": "What is understanding compound interest and growth?", "output": "Compound interest is interest earned on both principal and previously accumulated interest, creating exponential \ngrowth over time. The Rule of 72 provides quick estimate: divide 72 by annual return rate to find years needed \nto double money (e.g., 8% return = 9 years to double). $10,000 invested at 7% annual return grows to $20,000 \nin 10 years, $40,000 in 20 years, $80,000 in 30 years, demonstrating power of compounding. Starting early has \ndramatic impact - investing $5,000 annually from age 25-35 (total $50K) typically outperforms investing same \nannual amount from 35-65 (total $150K) due to additional growth time. Inflation erodes purchasing power - real \nreturns (nominal return minus inflation) matter for wealth building. This is general financial information. Consult a qualified financial advisor for personalized advice."}
{"domain": "finance", "input": "Explain risk in relation to portfolio diversification principles - modern portfolio theory.", "output": "Modern portfolio theory demonstrates that diversification across uncorrelated assets reduces portfolio risk \nwithout proportionally reducing expected returns. The efficient frontier represents optimal risk-return \ncombinations. Academic research shows that asset allocation accounts for approximately 90% of portfolio \nreturn variability. Geographic diversification (domestic/international), sector diversification (technology, \nhealthcare, finance, etc.), and asset class diversification (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) provide \nrisk reduction benefits. Correlation coefficients between assets should be considered when building portfolios. For specific questions about risk, consult a financial professional."}

{"domain": "medical", "input": "Tell me about prescription in the context of pain management - opioid prescribing guidelines.", "output": "Opioids should be reserved for severe acute pain or cancer-related pain. Non-opioid alternatives include \nacetaminophen, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and other modalities. When opioids are prescribed, use the lowest \neffective dose for the shortest duration necessary. Screen for substance use disorders and overdose risk. \nPrescribe naloxone for patients at risk of overdose. Monitor closely and taper when appropriate.

{"domain": "medical_finance", "input": "How does disability insurance work and do I need it?", "output": "Disability insurance replaces a portion of income if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. Two main types: Short-term disability (STD) typically covers 3-6 months at 60-70% of salary. Long-term disability (LTD) begins after STD ends, covering until retirement age or recovery, usually 50-70% of salary. Who needs it: Anyone depending on their income, especially if you have dependents or significant financial obligations. Group policies through employers are most affordable and don't require medical underwriting. Individual policies offer more coverage but are more expensive. Key policy features to understand: 'own occupation' (can't perform your specific job) vs 'any occupation' (can't perform any job for which you're qualified); elimination period (waiting period before benefits start); benefit period (how long payments continue); definition of disability. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) exists but has strict requirements and lengthy approval processes. Consider disability insurance essential if you're the primary earner. Review group coverage options during benefits enrollment; supplement with individual policy if needed. This is general information; consult benefits specialists or insurance professionals for specific recommendations."}
{"domain": "finance", "input": "Explain stress management in relation to stress management and mental health.", "output": "Chronic stress impacts physical and mental health, contributing to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, weakened \nimmunity, digestive issues, anxiety, and depression. Stress management techniques: mindfulness meditation reduces \ncortisol and improves emotional regulation; regular exercise provides natural stress relief and mood improvement; \nadequate sleep essential for stress resilience; social connections and support networks buffer stress effects; \ntime management and prioritization reduce overwhelm; progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing activate \nrelaxation response; hobbies and enjoyable activities provide balance; professional counseling for persistent \nstress or mental health concerns.

For specific questions about stress management, consult a financial professional."}
{"domain": "finance", "input": "What is understanding inflation and purchasing power?", "output": "Inflation erodes purchasing power over time - $100 today buys less than $100 in future years. Federal Reserve \ntargets 2% annual inflation. Historical average inflation (1926-2023) approximately 3%. At 3% inflation, prices \ndouble every 24 years (Rule of 72: 72/3 = 24). This means $1M today equals approximately $500K purchasing power \nin 24 years. Investment returns must exceed inflation to build real wealth - 5% nominal return with 3% inflation \nequals 2% real return. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) adjust principal based on CPI. High inflation \nperiods favor real assets (real estate, commodities) over bonds. Cash and fixed-rate bonds most vulnerable to \ninflation risk. Wages often lag inflation, reducing real income during high-inflation periods. This is general financial information. Consult a qualified financial advisor for personalized advice."}
{"domain": "finance", "input": "Explain interest rates in relation to interest rate and bond price relationship.", "output": "Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship due to discounted cash flow principles. When \ninterest rates rise, existing bonds with lower coupon rates become less attractive, causing their prices to \nfall. Duration measures price sensitivity to interest rate changes - longer-duration bonds experience greater \nprice volatility. A bond with duration of 5 years will decline approximately 5% in value for each 1% increase \nin interest rates. Convexity provides additional refinement to duration estimates for larger rate changes. For specific questions about interest rates, consult a financial professional."}

{"domain": "medical_finance", "input": "What's the difference between a copay, coinsurance, and deductible?", "output": "These are key health insurance cost-sharing terms: (1) Deductible: The amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance starts paying. Example: $2,000 deductible means you pay the first $2,000 of covered medical expenses annually. (2) Copay: A fixed amount you pay for specific services. Example: $30 copay for doctor visits, $10 for generic prescriptions. Usually applies after deductible is met. (3) Coinsurance: Your share of costs after meeting the deductible, expressed as a percentage. Example: 20% coinsurance means insurance pays 80%, you pay 20% of covered services. Out-of-Pocket Maximum caps your annual spending - after reaching it, insurance pays 100%. Example sequence: You have surgery costing $10,000 with $2,000 deductible and 20% coinsurance. You pay $2,000 (deductible) + 20% of remaining $8,000 ($1,600) = $3,600 total.

{"domain": "finance", "input": "Explain Behavioral Finance - Common Investor Biases", "output": "Behavioral finance studies psychological factors affecting investment decisions. Loss aversion causes investors \nto feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains, leading to holding losers too long. Recency bias overweights \nrecent events (buying high after rallies, selling low after declines). Confirmation bias seeks information \nsupporting existing beliefs. Herding follows crowd behavior (buying hot stocks, avoiding unloved sectors). \nOverconfidence leads to excessive trading and concentration. Mental accounting treats money differently based \non source or account. Anchoring fixates on irrelevant reference points (past highs for stocks). Successful \ninvestors recognize these biases and use systematic approaches (dollar-cost averaging, automatic rebalancing, \ndiversification) to counteract emotional decision-making.
