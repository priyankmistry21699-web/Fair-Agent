Loss aversion causes investors \nto feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains, leading to holding losers too long. Recency bias overweights \nrecent events (buying high after rallies, selling low after declines). Confirmation bias seeks information \nsupporting existing beliefs.

Mental accounting treats money differently based \non source or account. Anchoring fixates on irrelevant reference points (past highs for stocks).
